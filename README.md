<p align="left">My name is Yurong Liu, a first-year CS Ph.D. at New York University. I want to bridge the gap between theory and practice in data management.

Recently, under the expert guidance of Prof. Juliana Freire and Prof. Christopher Musco, my focus has shifted towards an in-depth exploration of data cleaning and integration, delving into both algorithmic techniques and deep learning approaches, particularly in representation learning, from a theoretical standpoint.
