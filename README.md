<p align="center"><strong>✨Hi!!🪐</strong></p>
<p align="left">My name is Yurong Liu, a CS Ph.D. student at New York University working under Prof. Juliana Freire. My research centers on data-centric AI, integrating data management, machine learning, and theoretical computer science.
  
Previously, I jointly pursued an Honors B.S. in Computer Science and an Honors B.A. in Mathematics at the University of Rochester, where I was fortunate to have worked with Prof. Fatemeh Nargesian, Prof.  Daniel Stefankovic, and Prof. Jiebo Luo.
