<p align="left">My name is Yurong Liu, a first-year CS Ph.D. at New York University. 

Recently, under the expert guidance of Prof. Juliana Freire and Prof. Christopher Musco, my focus has shifted towards an in-depth exploration of data integration and processing, delving into both algorithmic techniques and deep learning approaches.
